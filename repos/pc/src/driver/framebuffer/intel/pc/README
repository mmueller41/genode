This driver is for Intel i915 compatible graphic cards.

Default behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When no configuration is provided to the driver, it will enable all connectors
with attached displays and allocate one shared framebuffer for all displays
(see non-discrete mode below). It will use the highest resolution as provided
by the BIOS or EDID information. For each discrete connector a separate
Capture connection will be requested labeled according to the connector name.
When newly connected displays are detected by the driver, the new connectors
are enabled and another Capture session labeled according to the connector
will be requested.

By default, on hotplug of a display, the current config of the driver will be
re-parsed and re-applied. This behaviour can be disabled by

! <config apply_on_hotplug="no"/>

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To present all available connectors and their possible resolutions to the user,
the driver is able to deliver a corresponding report, which can be enabled
in the configuration as follows:

! <config>
!   <report connectors="yes"/>
! </config>

The exported report has the following format:

! <connectors>
!   <merge name="mirror">
!     <connector name="eDP-1" connected="true" brightness="50" width_mm="290" height_mm="170">
!       <mode width="1920" height="1080" hz="60" id="1" preferred="true" used="true" width_mm="288" height_mm="165"/>
!       ...
!     </connector>
!     <connector name="DP-1" connected="true" width_mm="280" height_mm="160">
!       <mode width="1920" height="1200" hz="60" id="1" preferred="true" width_mm="280" height_mm="160"/>
!       <mode width="1920" height="1080" hz="60" id="2" used="true" width_mm="278" height_mm="158"/>
!       <mode width="1280" height="1024" hz="60" id="3"/>
!       <mode width="1024" height="768"  hz="60" id="4"/>
!       ...
!     </connector>
!     <connector name="HDMI-A-1" connected="false"/>
!   </merge>
! </connectors>

The physical dimension of the display is reported as 'width_mm' and 'height_mm'
in millimeter per connector and if available, also per mode. The values can
be used as input to DPI calculations. The currently used mode of the connector
is tagged in the report explicitly.

Each of the connectors can be configured a specific mode and
whether it should be enabled or not. This looks like the following:

! <config>
!   <connector name="eDP-1" enabled="true" width="1920" height="1080" hz="60" brightness="75"/>
!   <connector name="DP-1"  enabled="true" mode="2"/>
! </config>

The resolution can be configured exactly by setting the 'mode' attribute
to one of the 'id' values of the reported modes or by setting the
width/height/hz attributes. In the latter case the driver will take the first
matching mode out of multiple matching modes potentially.

The brightness value is in percent and takes effect only if supported by
the hardware.

The maximal physical resolution across all connectors can be restricted by:

! <config max_width="2560" max_height="1440">
! </config>

Note: All larger modes still will be reported, but are marked as unusable
      by an additional attribute 'usable' set to false.

The amount of memory used by the driver for the accounting of its available
buffer space is set by:

! <config max_framebuffer_memory="64M">
! </config>

The default and minimal value is '64M' and suffices for resolutions of at
least '3840x2160'. How much actual memory is used depends on the configured
resolution.


Non-discrete usage of connectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mirrored usage of connectors can be achieved by moving those connectors into
a sub node called 'merge' of the configuration. For all those connectors,
exactly one and the same framebuffer will be used internally by the driver.
The driver will allocate the framebuffer large enough to accommodate all
non-discrete connectors. If some of the modes of the connectors are smaller,
than only a subset of the content will be visible on those displays.

! <connectors>
!
!   <connector name="eDP-1" ...> <!-- discrete, not mirrored -->
!      ...
!   </connector>
!   <connector name="DP-1" ...> <!.. discrete, not mirrored -->
!      ...
!   </connector>
!
!   <merge name="mirror">
!     <connector name="HDMI-A-1" ...>
!        ...
!     </connector>
!     <connector name="VGA--1" ...>
!        ...
!     </connector>
!   </merge>
! </connectors>

Note: If connectors are configured as non-discrete, they will also be
      reported inside a separate 'merge' node.

Additionally, the virtual resolution for non-discrete connectors may be
restricted via:

! <merge name="mirror" width="1024" height="768">
! ...
! </merge>

Thereby, the driver will open a Genode capture session to the
GUI multiplexer with this limited dimension.
