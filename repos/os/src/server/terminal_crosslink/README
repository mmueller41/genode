The 'terminal_crosslink' server allows exactly two clients to communicate with
each other using the 'Terminal' interface. Data sent to the server gets stored
in a buffer of configurable size (one buffer per client, 4K by default). The
'read()' and 'write()' calls never block. A signal receiver can be used to
block until new data is ready for reading.

Example
-------

An example depot package 'test-terminal_crosslink' can be found in the
'os/recipes/pkg' directory.
