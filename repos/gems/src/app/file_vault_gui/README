                             File Vault GUI
                              Martin Stein

A graphical front end for the File Vault based on a sandboxed menu view
component and the dialog API.

Disclaimer
~~~~~~~~~~

The current version of the File Vault is not intended for productive use but
for mere demonstrational purpose. Please refrain from storing sensitive data
with it.

Requires
~~~~~~~~

* A Report session "ui_config" that maps to the file_vault UI configuration
* A ROM session "ui_report" that maps to the file_vault UI report
* A File System session "menu_view -> fonts" to a fonts server
* A Gui session for the Menu View it spawns
* A Timer session

Controls menus explained
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Capacity:

Extend the capacity of the provided file system permanently. The number of
bytes entered here is usually not the same amount by which the file system
gets extended as the extension normally requires meta data. Doesn't interrupt
user interaction with the provided file system.

:Journaling buffer:

Extend the size of the buffer that the File Vault can use for snapshots and
copy-on-write permanently. As with the capacity, the number of bytes entered
is usually not the same amount by which the buffer grows. Doesn't interrupt
user interaction with the provided file system.

:Encryption key:

Generate a new random block encryption key, re-encrypt the entire File Vault
container with it, and dispose of the old encryption key. Doesn't interrupt
user interaction with the provided File System.
