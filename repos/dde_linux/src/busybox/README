Busybox port
############

For convenience reasons this target builds a busybox binary that can be used,
e.g., within run-scripts to provide an initram-filesystem for a Linux guest OS,
or native Linux kernel during device-driver porting.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tom compile and link busybox appropriatedly, the Genode toolchain is not
sufficient. Instead tools of the host system are used. When building busybox
on a x86_64 host machine for either ARM or x86 32-bit machines these targets
require a cross-compilation toolchain to be installed first.

On a x86_64 Debian-based machine, one needs to install for ARM 32-bit:

! apt-get install crossbuild-essential-armhf

and for ARM 64-bit:

! apt-get install crossbuild-essential-arm64

for x86 32-bit cross compilation, you need:

! apt-get install crossbuild-essential-i386
